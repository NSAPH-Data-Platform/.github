National Studies on Air Pollution and Health (NSAPH) is a group of faculty,
research scientists, post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, and college
students studying data science methodologies in the context of climate change,
environmental impacts on health outcomes, and regulatory policy. NSAPH research
ranges from statistical methodology, causal inference, machine learning,
measures of the environment on cardiovascular, respiratory, and neuro-cognitive
health outcomes, environmental justice, and data visualization.
                                                       
The NSAPH Data Platform is an 
[Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)
platform to create and deploy data processing and
Extract Transform Load / Extract Load Transform
(ETL/ELT) pipelines for
reproducible research. Deployment is assumed to be in a secure environment.

The platform includes a number of built-in pipelines.
